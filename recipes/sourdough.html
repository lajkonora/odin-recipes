<h1>Sourdough bread</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is a modified version of the Tartine bread recipe that Chad Robertson shares in his books Tartine Bread and Tartine No. 3. In my time as a home baker, I’ve gone back to Chad’s master recipe and the variations in these books again and again. It makes a very wet dough, which might feel unfamiliar to you at first, but it’s actually quite easy to work with. The tradeoff to the extra moisture is a really gorgeous crust and a chewy, well-developed crumb.</p>
    <p>I also want to encourage you to use this recipe as a jumping-off point. I made it with straight all-purpose or bread flour here, but you can swap in some whole-wheat flour or other whole-grain flour without needing to adjust the recipe. You can also add things like nuts or dried fruit, or experiment with folding in some cooked grains, like quinoa or steel-cut oats.
    </p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon active sourdough starter</li>
        <li>75 grams all-purpose flour or bread flour (1/2 cup)</li>
        <li>75 grams water (1/3 cup)</li>
        <li>525 grams water (2 1/2 cups), divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>700 grams all-purpose flour or bread flour (5 1/2 cups)</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the leaven and let it sit overnight. The night before you plan to make the dough, place all the leaven ingredients in a large bowl and mix thoroughly to form a thick batter. Cover and let stand at room temperature overnight, about 12 hours.</li>
        <li>Dissolve the salt. Place 50 grams (about 1/4 cup) of the water and the salt for the dough in a small bowl. Set aside, stirring occasionally to make sure the salt dissolves.</li>
        <li>Add the flour. Add the flour and stir with a rubber spatula until there are no more bits of dry flour and it forms a very shaggy dough.</li>
        <li>Let the dough rise undisturbed (30 to 60 minutes). Once you've finished the folds, cover and let the dough rise undisturbed for 30 to 60 minutes, until it looks slightly puffed. This dough won't double in size the way regular, non-sourdough breads will; it should just look larger than it did when you started.</li>
        <li>Shape the loaves. Dust the top of one of the balls of dough with flour. Flip it over with a pastry scraper so that the floured side is against the board and the un-floured, sticky surface is up.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 500°F. Place two Dutch ovens or other heavy-bottomed pots with lids in the oven, and heat to 500°F. (If you don't have two pots, you can bake one loaf after the next.)
        </li>
        <li>Bake the loaves for 20 minutes. Then, remove the lids and continue baking 15 to 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
