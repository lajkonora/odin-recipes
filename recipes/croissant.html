<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This simplified croissant recipe will have you baking croissants like a pro. Flaky, buttery, and deliciously authentic, yet so easy to make!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups unsalted butter, cold (2 1/2 sticks)</li>
        <li>1 cup milk (you may need slightly more or less)</li>
        <li>egg wash (1 large egg beaten with a teaspoon or two of water)</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a large bowl and whisk together until combined. </li>
        <li>Slice the butter into 1/8-inch thick slices and toss in the flour mixture to coat.</li>
        <li>Add the milk and stir together until a stiff dough forms. </li>
        <li>Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour. </li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a long rectangle shape. </li>
        <li>Fold it into thirds (like a letter), turn 90 degrees, and repeat 4 to 6 more times, or until the dough has large streaks of butter in it but it is smooth and flat. (If at any point the butter starts to feel soft, chill it in the refrigerator or freezer until stiff.) </li>
        <li>Cut the dough into long, skinny triangles (about 5-inches at the wide end). </li>
        <li>Notch the wide end of each triangle with about a 1/2-inch cut, then roll from the wide end to the pointed end, tucking the point under the croissant. </li>
        <li>Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and allow to proof until doubled in size (1 to 2 hours). </li>
        <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until puffed, golden brown, and flaky.  </li>
    </ol>
